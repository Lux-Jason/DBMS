The schema of a database for public transportation companies is as
follows. Keys are underlined.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(company = (\underline{cID},cname,address,phone)\)
\item
  \(route = (\underline{rID},departure,arrival,cID)\)


// \(cID\) is a foreign key to \(company.cID\).
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(vehicle = (\underline{plateNum},model,capacity,manufacturer,cID)\)


// \(cID\) is a foreign key to \(company.cID\).
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(driver = (\underline{dID},name,\ gender,age,cID)\)


// \(cID\) is a foreign key to \(company.cID\).
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(serve = (\underline{rID,plateNum})\)


// \(rID\) is a foreign key to \(route.rID\).

Q2. Write a query for each following question. Assuming students' name
and instructors' name are unique. (10pt for each)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\item
  Find the number of vehicles owned by ``Xinhe'' (company name).
  
  \begin{verbatim}
  	SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_vehicles
  	FROM Vehicles
  	WHERE company_name = 'Xinhe';
  \end{verbatim}
  
\item
  Find the companies who owns more than 10 vehicles. Show the company
  names and number of vehicles owned by each.
  
  \begin{verbatim}
  	SELECT company_name, COUNT(*) AS num_vehicles
  	FROM Vehicles
  	GROUP BY company_name
  	HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
  \end{verbatim}
\item
  Find the route which is served by more vehicles than other routes.
  Show the departure and the arrival of the route.
  
  \begin{verbatim}
  	SELECT departure, arrival
  	FROM Routes
  	WHERE route_id = (

	\subsection*{Explanation of Design}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Vehicles Table}: Contains information about the vehicles, with \texttt{vehicle\_id} as the primary key. The \texttt{company\_name} indicates the company that owns the vehicle, and \texttt{route\_id} links the vehicle to a specific route via a foreign key to the \texttt{Routes} table.
		\item \textbf{Routes Table}: Stores information about the routes, including a unique \texttt{route\_id}, departure, and arrival locations.
		\item \textbf{Drivers Table}: Contains driver details, with \texttt{driver\_id} as the primary key. Each driver is linked to a vehicle through \texttt{vehicle\_id} (foreign key). The \texttt{gender} field has a constraint to ensure that the value is either 'M' or 'F'.
		\item \textbf{Companies Table}: Stores company information such as \texttt{company\_name}, address, and contact details. \texttt{company\_name} is the primary key.
		\item \textbf{Manufacturers Table}: Stores manufacturer details for the vehicles. \texttt{manufacturer\_id} is the primary key, and it stores the name and country of the manufacturer.
		\item \textbf{Route\_Vehicle Table}: A junction table to handle the many-to-many relationship between routes and vehicles. A vehicle can be assigned to multiple routes, and a route can have multiple vehicles.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Foreign Key Relationships}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Vehicles Table} references \textbf{Routes} using \texttt{route\_id}.
		\item \textbf{Drivers Table} references \textbf{Vehicles} using \texttt{vehicle\_id}.
		\item \textbf{Route\_Vehicle Table} is used to link vehicles and routes with a many-to-many relationship.
		\item \textbf{Vehicles Table} also references \textbf{Companies} indirectly through the \texttt{company\_name}.

Q4. The above schema is converted from an ER diagram which has
\(company\), \(route\), \(vechile\), and \(driver\) as entity sets;
\(serve\) and \(drive\) as relationship sets. What are the constraints
on the two relationship sets? (10 pt)

\section*{Answer:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Entities}: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Company
		\item Route
		\item Vehicle
		\item Driver
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Relationships}: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Serve (between Company and Route)
		\item Drive (between Driver and Vehicle)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Based on the schema and relationship sets, the constraints on the relationships are as follows:

\subsection*{1. Serve Relationship (between Company and Route)}
The \textbf{Serve} relationship connects the entities \textbf{Company} and \textbf{Route}, indicating that a company is responsible for operating a route.

\textbf{Constraints on the Serve Relationship}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Cardinality}: A company can serve multiple routes, and a route can be served by one or more companies. This is a \textbf{many-to-many} relationship.
	\item \textbf{Participation Constraints}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Total Participation}: A route must be served by at least one company (if the route exists, it must have a company assigned to it).
		\item \textbf{Partial Participation}: A company may serve zero or more routes (it’s possible that a company may not serve any routes).
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Foreign Keys}: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{company\_name} (references the Company entity)
		\item \textbf{route\_id} (references the Route entity)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Drive Relationship (between Driver and Vehicle)}
The \textbf{Drive} relationship connects the entities \textbf{Driver} and \textbf{Vehicle}, indicating that a driver is assigned to drive a specific vehicle.

\textbf{Constraints on the Drive Relationship}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Cardinality}: A vehicle can be driven by multiple drivers, and a driver can be assigned to multiple vehicles. This is a \textbf{many-to-many} relationship.
	\item \textbf{Participation Constraints}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Total Participation}: Every driver must be assigned to at least one vehicle. A driver cannot exist without being assigned to a vehicle.
		\item \textbf{Partial Participation}: A vehicle may not necessarily have a driver assigned at any given time (this could be the case for new vehicles or during non-operational hours).
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Foreign Keys}: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{driver\_id} (references the Driver entity)
		\item \textbf{vehicle\_id} (references the Vehicle entity)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{comment}
	\subsection*{Summary of Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Serve Relationship}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Cardinality}: Many-to-many (a company can serve multiple routes, and a route can be served by multiple companies).
			\item \textbf{Participation}: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Route}: Total participation (every route must be served by at least one company).
				\item \textbf{Company}: Partial participation (a company may not serve any routes).
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Foreign Keys}: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{company\_name} (references the Company)
				\item \textbf{route\_id} (references the Route)
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Drive Relationship}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Cardinality}: Many-to-many (a vehicle can be driven by multiple drivers, and a driver can drive multiple vehicles).
			\item \textbf{Participation}: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Driver}: Total participation (every driver must be assigned to at least one vehicle).
				\item \textbf{Vehicle}: Partial participation (a vehicle may not have a driver assigned).
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Foreign Keys}: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{driver\_id} (references the Driver)
				\item \textbf{vehicle\_id} (references the Vehicle)
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
